## Solid_Token_Builder



## Abstract

The objective of this project is to ensure a stable and robust digital ecosystem by creating a custom token through the application of the Solidity language.

## Project Summary

* I have created my own token named "Tush" abbreviated as "Man". There is the record of its total supply. And if someone mints some "Man" tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it. Also if someone burns those tokens, it will get subtracted from the total supply.

## Setup

* The project was primarily executed on the Online Remix IDE, followed by the creation of the 'Tu.sol' file within this repository to facilitate seamless integration with GitHub.

## Implementation

The execution of the code was managed using the remix.ide platform.

## Functional Workflow

1.	Initialization by creating a designated folder.
2.	Automatic compilation and code execution facilitated by the Remix tool or manual execution via the "Compile and Run" option.
3.	Successful deployment of the contract, resulting in the generation of an account address.
4.	Verification of the completion of the deployment process.
5.	Setting the initial account balance to zero.
6.	Token minting process involving the input of the account address, desired token quantity (e.g., 900), and execution through the "Transact" option.
7.	Checking of the account balance through the "Balances" option.
8.	Accessing the token supply information.
9.	Token burning process requiring the account address and token quantity for removal, followed by execution using the "Transact" option.
10.	Post-burning balance reassessment through the "Call" option.
11.	To burn tokens from your account click on "Burn " paste in your account address specify how tokens you want to burn (500) and click "Transact" to reduce them from your account.
12.After burning tokens reassess your balance by pressing "Call" to get an updated balance (e.g. if you burned 500 tokens from a 900 token balance you should now have 400 tokens remaining).
13.	The contract encompasses all essential functionalities highlighted above.
